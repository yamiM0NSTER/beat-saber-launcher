# Example use case

Billy is annoyed with random Beat Saber updates that break his mod setup and he can't play his favorite game. Billy found this page, here's what he did:

1. Billy gets Beat Saber Launcher.
2. Billy makes Beat Saber folder copy of his current install with mods setup and names it "Beat Saber 1.18.3". \
